# Geospatial data with ArcGis using Python 3

Unfortunately, Arc is not open source, so for this class we will use a free trial version of ArcGis Pro.
You need to have a windows environment for Arc if you are on a Mac or Linux OS.
The following pdf describes how to get the 21-day trial version onto your local machine
step by step with pictures. The trial version will be good to go for the class if you install anytime after August 15th.

If you are already using ArcMap, please still install ArcGis Pro to follow along in class. Commands differ slightly
between these two versions, but after the lecture you should be able to implement everything in ArcMap as well.

Go to the ArcGis trial page [here](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial)
and then follow the steps outlined in the pdf:
