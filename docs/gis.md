# Geospatial data with ArcGis using Python 3

Unfortunately, Arc is not open source, so for this class we will use a free trial version of ArcGis Pro. The following pdf describes how to get the 21-day trial version onto your local machine step by step with pictures. The trial version will be good to go for the class if you install anytime **after August 15th**.

Go to the ArcGis trial page [here](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial)
and then follow the steps outlined in the pdf:

!!! note
    * ArcGis is only available for Windows. If you are on a Mac or Linux and want to participate in this part, you need to have a Windows environment.
    * If you are already using ArcMap, please still install ArcGis Pro to follow along in class. Commands differ slightly between these two versions, but after the lecture you should be able to implement everything in ArcMap as well.
