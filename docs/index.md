# Tilburg Science Hub

*Tilburg Science Hub* is an open-source resource repository that supports students and researchers
in the social sciences to *efficiently manage data- and computation-intensive projects*.

To get you started, we have curated a *bootcamp in scientific computing and reproducible science*.

### Bootcamp in Scientific Computing and Reproducible Science

- Learn how to set up your computing environment (&rarr; [software setup](setup/)),
- Implement workflows to manage complex computational projects (&rarr; [project setup and workflow management](workflow/) ),
- Browse a library of tips & tricks (such as how to learn R&rarr; [tips and manuals](tips/)), and
- Get inspired by learning from various templates (&rarr; [example projects](examples/)).

In the near future, we are planning on releasing resources on *creating R packages*
and on *efficiently managing web data collections using scraping/APIs and (un)structured databases*.

!!! hint "Do I really need this site?"

    - No matter how confident you are about your computer skills, chance is that
    even the brightest ones among us *manage their projects by intuition*. A directory
    here, a code file there, and - oh, where to store raw data again?
    - Over the years, we have experienced that purely relying on intuition in managing
    data- and computation-intensive projects is a bad idea. After all, we spend
    a considerable amount of time studying past literature to seek an academic contribution.
    Hence, the idea to learn from others on how to manage the *process of working on a
    data- and/or computation intensive project* shouldn't sound that far-fetched.
    - That's why we have created this site, and curated material to make sure that
    your computer skills are at par with your ambition to be a productive researcher.
    - Last, we have a few tips on how to use our site:
        * Bookmark our site and check back frequently (the page isn't meant to be a "one-shot" exercise).
    	  * Science is a process, and you can already start today to manage it more efficiently (e.g., by setting up directory structures in a better way).
        However, mastering the more advanced skills will take you some time, and we ask for your patience.
