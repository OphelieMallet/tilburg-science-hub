<!-- These pages should help you to get started setting up the computing environment on your machine ready for the course "Programming Practices for Research in Economics" at the University of Zurich in Fall 2016.


* If everything goes smoothly, you should be able to complete the installation in one sitting within 60-120 minutes.
* Please follow the steps one-by-one in the order they appear on the side bar and do not deviate from them, unless you really know what you are doing.
* If you find any outdated links or unclear descriptions, email me (Lachlan) so that I can update them or clarify as needed.
* As needed, we have provided instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux machines.

**Please attempt to install necessary all packages prior to the beginning of the each session.**

We will be able to assist you in during the coffee breaks and before / after sessions, but it will be much easier if you have attempted it first. -->
