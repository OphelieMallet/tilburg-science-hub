These pages should help you to get started setting up the computing environment on your machine ready for the course "Programming Practices for Research in Economics" at the University of Zurich in Fall 2017.


* If everything goes smoothly, you should be able to complete the installation in one sitting within 60-120 minutes.
* Please follow the steps one-by-one in the order they appear on the side bar and do not deviate from them, unless you really know what you are doing.
* If you find any outdated links or unclear descriptions, email me us at [programming@econ.uzh.ch]() so that we can update the instructions or clarify as needed.
* Where necessary, we have provided instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux machines.

**Please attempt to install necessary all packages prior to the beginning of the each session.**

* We will hold an *installation surgery* sesson, on Friday the 25th of August from 14.00 - 16.00 to help people who have attempted to install all the necessary programs but have had  some problems doing so, *in a as yet unknown location*.
* Do not come to the installation surgery expecting us to 'install everything for you' - there is not enough time, and it is a useful exercise for you to get comfortable installing software onto your laptop or workstation that is necessary for you to complete your research.
* We can also offer assistance during the coffee breaks and before / after sessions, but it will be much easier and less stressful for you if everything is working before the course begins.
