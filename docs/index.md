* If everything goes smoothly, you should be able to complete the installation in one sitting within 60-120 minutes.
* Please follow the steps one-by-one in the order they appear on the side bar and do not deviate from them, unless you really know what you are doing.
* If you find any outdated links or unclear descriptions, email me (Lachlan) so that I can update them or clarify as needed.
* As needed, we have provided instructions for Mac, Windows and Linux machines.

**Please attempt to install necessary all packages prior to the beginning of the each session.**
