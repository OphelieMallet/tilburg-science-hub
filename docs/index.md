# Bootcamp in Scientific Computing and Reproducible Science

<!--## Getting your computer skills up-to-date
-->
These website should help you to get started in

- setting up the computing environment on your machine (--> [software setup](setup/)),
- understanding the main principles of reproducible science, and how they can be applied in a set of standardized workflows (--> [project setup and workflow management](workflow/) ),
- browsing a library of tips & tricks (such as how to learn R --> [tips and manuals](tips/)), and
- directly implementing our suggestions by learning from various templates (--> [example projects](examples/)).

both of which will allow you to manage *data- and computation-intensive projects* in an efficient way.

!!! tip
    * Rather than seeing this page as a one-time exercise, we encourage you to bookmark it and come back to it frequently.
	* Reproducible science is a process - you can start today (e.g., by setting up file structures in a better way), but it will take time to master the more advanced skills.
	* If you find any outdated content, links or unclear descriptions, email us at [h.datta@tilburguniversity.edu]() so that we can update the instructions or clarify as needed.

## Why this site?

No matter how confident you may be about your computer skills, chance is that
even the brightest ones among us have learnt them on the fly.
You may have seen a statistical software package coming by at grad school,
but that's about it.

Well, over the years, we have experienced that having your use of the computer
fully been guided by intuition is actually not a good idea.

That's why we have assembled a couple of tips to make sure that your
computer skills are at par with your ambition to write a good paper.

Think you don't need it? Nah, we don't think so. So please take your time
to dig into this.
