This site builds on the shoulders of academics Lachlan Deer, Adrian Etter, Julian Langer, and Max Winkler at the Department of Economics, University of Zurich.

It has been modified later by Hannes Datta at Tilburg University, with a grant to stimulate the usage of reproducible science tools at 
the Tilburg School of Economics and Management.
