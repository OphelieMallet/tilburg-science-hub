## Acknowledgements

Part of this module is based on the 2016 and 2017 versions of the course:

* [`Programming Practices For Economists`](pp4rs.github.io/2017-uzh), by Lachlan Deer, Adrian Etter, Julian Langer & Max Winkler

It is designed after and borrows a lot from:

* [`Effective Programming Practices for Economists`](http://wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/teaching/prog_econ_slides.html#prog-econ-slides), a course by [Hans-Martin von Gaudecker](http://wiwi.uni-bonn.de/gaudecker/index.html)
* Software Carpentry's [`Managing Software Research Projects`](https://swcarpentry.github.io/managing-research-software-projects/) lesson

We also borrow a lot from the papers

* Wilson G, Aruliah DA, Brown CT, Chue Hong NP, Davis M, Guy RT, et al. (2014) [`Best Practices for Scientific Computing`](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745). PLoS Biol 12(1): e1001745.
* Gentzkow, M., & Shapiro, J.M. (2014). [Code and data for the social sciences: A practitionerâ€™s guide](https://home.bi.no/charlotte.ostergaard/students/CodeAndData.pdf). Chicago, IL: University of Chicago.
