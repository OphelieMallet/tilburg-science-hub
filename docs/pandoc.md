# Pandoc

Pandoc is an extremely useful 'swiss army knife' for converting between different types of markup languages from the command line.
For example, it readily builds PDFs with latex, and markdown - both of which are heavily used in academic research.

We do not actively teach how to use Pandoc in the course - but we will utilize it in some lessons where we produce PDF, Word or HTML output from plain text files.

## Installation

* Go to the [Pandoc Homepage](https://pandoc.org/) and follow the instructions on installation for your operating system.
* Verify your install by typing the following into a command line:
```bash
pandoc --version
```
The expected output starts with the following information:
```bash
pandoc 1.17.2
```
Ensure you have at least version 1.17.1 installed.

## Windows Users
