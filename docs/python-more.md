# Additional Python packages

Anaconda's Python Distribution comes with many of the packages we need to do scientific computing.
If you're interested in all the packages included, click [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs) and go to the Python 3.6 tab.

Howevever, you may come across packages that are not installed by default.
In this case we recommend you use the `pip` package management tool to install them.

For this course, we will need the package `Selenium` as part of the web scraping toolkit we will build up. We install it, by entering the following into a terminal:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

`pip` will then go through and install the package we asked for, and any dependencies.
If this succeeded, the last line it printed out should be:

```
Successfully installed selenium-3.5.0
```
