# Installing Python Dependencies for Waf

Waf is an alternative to make.
It also controls the execution of command line statements, but does so in a different manner that may be more conducive to the standard work-flow of economists.

Waf is a Python add-on, so we will need to install some extra python modules to ensure everything works "nicely."

Type the following commands into the terminal:

    conda install coverage
    pip install sphinxcontrib-bibtex

Then wait until the installation is completed.
